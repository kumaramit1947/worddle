Project title: Worddle -- clone of WORDLE word guess game
Instructions: 1. Guess the correct word
              2. Maximum attempt for a word = 6
              3. Number of letters in each word = 5
              4. Repeated words can not be entered
              5. Press enter after each guess to see if your guess is correct or not
              6. Refresh the window to play another round
Color coding: When a word is guessed, the colors of the letters in the guessed word
              in both Grid and Keypad changes based on their accuracy--
              a. Green: if the letter guessed is at the exact correct position
              b. Yellow: if the letter is present in the actual solution word but
                 not at the same position where it is guessed
              c. Grey: if the letter is not present in the actual solution at all
Result:       a. Win: If all the letters guessed in a word turns green
              b. Lose: If the chances are over before you win
